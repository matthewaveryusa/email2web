this is a cloudflare worker that receives emails on email2web@matthewaveryusa.com and posts the (raw for now) content on email2web.matthewaveryusa.com/the@sender.email

I used the tutorial from [Cloudflare's getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) but it's basiclly 

```bash
npx wrangler init my-project
cd my-project
npx wrangler publish
```


the cool part is it's all workers/lambdas for processing the emails and serving the content!
